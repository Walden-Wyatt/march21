  <h1>  This the First HTML Page Created  </h1>

  <h2>  This is the second Line of code in this page after deploying the website  </h2>
                   
  <p>  If you make changes to your website's project folder after it has been deployed on Netlify, you will need to rebuild and redeploy your website for those changes to be reflected.

                        To do this, follow these steps:
                        
                            Commit your changes: Make sure to commit your changes to your Git repository by running the git add . and git commit -m "commit message" commands in your project directory.
                        
                            Push your changes to Git: After committing your changes, push your changes to your Git repository by running the git push command.
                        
                            Netlify will detect your changes: Netlify will automatically detect that changes have been pushed to your Git repository and will rebuild and redeploy your website.
                        
                            Wait for the deployment to finish: Depending on the size of your website and the number of changes you made, the rebuild and redeploy process may take some time. You can monitor the progress of the deployment in your Netlify dashboard.
                        
                            Test your website: After the deployment has finished, you can test your website to make sure your changes have been successfully applied.
                        
                        That's it! By following these steps, you can make changes to your website's project folder and ensure that those changes are reflected on your live website hosted on Netlify.   </p>
